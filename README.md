To play the game, make sure p5 is installed then hit GO LIVE on vscode on sketch.
The rules are simple:
-There are 4 squares onscreen
|4|5|
|1|2|
- In each of the squares, there is a color word
- In one of them, the font color matches the color word
- Hit the corresponding number on the numpad before the time for the turn runs out

- SPECIAL NOTE: if the numpad is unresponsive, try checking the numlock
- upon reaching 100 turns, the game WILL download your game data
- The game comes with a text file created by Stroop gan py which features a GAN trained on the test data also included in the repo
